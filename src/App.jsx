          React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you
          can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to
          get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or
          start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help
          you get started.

          As your application grows, you might want to consider a more
          integrated setup. There are several JavaScript toolchains we recommend
          for larger applications. Each of them can work with little to no
          configuration and lets you take full advantage of the rich React
          ecosystem. Learn how.
